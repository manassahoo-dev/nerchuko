        "descriptionLong": "My name is Hitesh and I am from Andhra Pradesh (India). <br/>I teach Telugu. I am also a published author (Not self-published) in Telugu, have had published three novels and several short stories till to date. <br/>I have been already teaching Telugu to NRIs and foreigners as well as non-Telugu speaking Indians so I knew the difficulties of learning a new language along with solutions.Coming to my teaching method, I will first ask the students about their learning objectives and then tailor-make my lessons according to their needs, goals, and level of understanding. Though my approach is student centric, I normally teach via PPT slides, picture images and using the real time examples. As I am storyteller, I make my students read my stories and help them understand the usage of the same words in different contexts/situations. I also give material at the end of each class so that students can prepare/recollect topics on their own.",
